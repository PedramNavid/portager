# Communicating Data

## Stages of a data science project

[answer]: Project sponsor: represents the business interests. 
</div>

Without communication, it's useless. 

## Communication principles

- Presentation to sponsor/stakeholders
- Documentation of model for operations
- Different audiences require different communication outputs

## Reproducible Research

- Option 1: manually create all artefacts
- Option 2: produce as much as possible through R using knitr/markdown

## Option 2: The Better Way

*R Markdown* 

This presentation was created in R using Markdown.

Prefer minimal text to generate clean, readable output

## Notebooks

In addition to presentations, you can create entire notebooks that
capture the research process.
