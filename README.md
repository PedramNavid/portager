# portager

An R package to teach non-R users about R, in R. (NOT YET DONE.)

## Background

A portage is the route between two bodies of water, travelled with a canoe on your head, typically en route to a camp site.
The journey is difficult. It's hard to see what you're doing, or why, when you're walking through the woods with a 45 lb
canoe on your head and a bag full of gear hanging off your shoulders. You're probably getting bit with bugs along the way. 

In short, learning R is a lot like going on a portage. However, like a portage, the end result is something really beautiful.

The goal of **portager** is to guide you along that trip, hopefully making it a slightly easier trek. 

## Philosophy

There are as many ways of learning R as there are R users. There are many different use-cases all with their own particular
particularities. portageR doensn't pretend to capture everything, but rather focuses essentially on using R for business
analysis. 

The goal is to bring the power of reproducability, testability, documentation, source control, and peer review to business
data analysis. 

Underlying the goal is the desire to make the transition from what is likely to be Excel-based analysis to R as painless
as possible, though not painless. To that end, the focus is on a set of packages toward which I have certain obvious biases
in order to reduce the hurdle to entry.
